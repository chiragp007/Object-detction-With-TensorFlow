Wheat-Head-Detction

STEP-1

  -: dataset-:https://www.kaggle.com/c/global-wheat-detection/data?select=train 

  -: download-> https://github.com/tensorflow/models
  
  -: filter you image data 
  
  -: if there is no BBOX in csv for images then remove those images from dataset
  
  -: csv manipulation
  
  -: now you have (filterd images + csv)
  
  -: create Train.csv and Test.csv
  
  -: create train and test image folder
  
  -: create train.record and test.record
  
  -: I set num_steps: 4310 in "faster_rcnn_resnet50_pets.config" you can change it(initially it is 200000) 
  
  -: path to get this file 
        "/models-master/research/object_detection/samples/configs/faster_rcnn_resnet50_pets.config"
  
  -: train your model
  
  -: MAKE SURE, "SET PATH" WHENEVER IT REQUIRES
  
  -: Use this "sys.path.append("../slim")'
  
  -: start training, it will take lots of time
  
  -: Export Graph with "export_inference_graph.py",  run this file from your Terminal, Don't forget to put path in the file
  

STEP-2

   -:Use saved .pb file
   
   -:Load it.
   
   -:and create rectangle wherever it is detected using OpenCv
